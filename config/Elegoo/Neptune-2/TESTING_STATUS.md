## Testing status

The 1.3 BLTouch Version for tne Neptune 2 and 2d are confirmed to be working in this release.

# Known issues and workarounds

## Screen calibration freezes

After you click the bottom right calibration point, reboot your machine if it prompts you to click the top left again, and you see two calibration touch points on the screen. I have never had to do this more than twice.

## Machine Keeps Rebooting

**Solution:** Remove the SD card with the firmware on it.
