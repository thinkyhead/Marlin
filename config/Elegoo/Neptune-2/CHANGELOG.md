## [2.0.9.3-N2-rc3] - 2021-03-21

### Added
- Enabled FAN_KICKSTART_TIME as some users reported fan not kicking on for slower speeds

### Changed

- Removed custom colors - no longer needed
- Updated HEATER_0_MAXTEMP from 270 to 275 per request
- Updated BED_MAXTEMP from 110 to 120 per request
- Updated DEFAULT_ZJERK from 0.4 to 0.3 to match other ender clones
- Updated Z_PROBE_FEEDRATE_SLOW from 300 to match Marlin defaults (it ends up being the same value)
- Updated Z_PROBE_OFFSET_RANGE_MAX from 60 to 65 per request
- Updated Z_PROBE_END_SCRIPT to add acceleration setting per user comment
- Updated HOMING_FEEDRATE_MM_M to match other ender clones
- Disabled define NO_WORKSPACE_OFFSETS since we don't need a leaner Marlin build and allows this feature (per request)
- Updated THERMAL_PROTECTION_BED_PERIOD from 40 to 20 to match other ender clones

### Fixed

- Found proper definition for LCD to allow for better screen contrast by disabling MKS_ROBIN_TFT35 and enabling TFT_GENERIC, and set its child values to fix screen color issues (Closes #13)
- Changed ADVANCED_PAUSE_RESUME_PRIME to 0 to prevent extra purge on filament change mid-print (M600).

## [2.0.9.3-N2-rc2] - 2021-01-16

### Added
- Keep Z Stepper active to prevent nozzle dropping
- Turn on fan animation (I know, just minor eye candy)
- Turn on Classic Jerk vs. using EJerk (recommended for use on cartesian printers)
- Enabled bed leveling to be probed twice for higher accuracy
- Make homing required after stepper motors are enabled (prevents inaccurate readings and moving axis points beyond limits)
- Changed logic for bed mesh to extrapolate calculations beyond bed probe grid.
- Center bed after probing (allows touch screen access after probing)

### Changed
- set `BAUDRATE` to `115200` due to some reliability issues reported by users
- Set `ESTEPS` to 2S and 2D Elegoo defaults
- set extruder min temperature to `180`

### Removed
